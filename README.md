# QuakeReport
Quake Report App from Udacity's Android basic course - Networking

This app uses a **listview** to display data of the recent earthquakes. The data is fetched from https://earthquake.usgs.gov using a htttp request.
The USGS API returns the JSON data which is parsed and displayed in the listview.
